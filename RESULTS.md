## Project Description
This project involves the analysis of the OpenFlights dataset. This is an open source data set of flights routes and airports. (
The OpenFlights Airports Database contains over 10,000 airports spanning the globe.
The data we plan to use can be found here:
[OpenFlights](https://openflights.org/data.html))

Our project builds a graph from this dataset using an adjacency matrix. We then allow the user to implement different algorithms, including breadth-first traversal, Djikstra's Algorithm, Landmark Path Algorithm. The user can also choose to display the airports, as well as the output of the landmark path algorithm, on a world map.

We have also tested our code using the Catch testing framework.
