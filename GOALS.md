## Project Description
We plan to use an open source data set of flights routes and airports from OpenFlights dataset. 
The OpenFlights Airports Database contains over 10,000 airports spanning the globe.
The data we plan to use can be found here:
[OpenFlights](https://openflights.org/data.html)

We plan to implement the graph data structure to complete our project.

We aim to accomplish the following in our project:

- Traverse through the data set using a **breadth-first** approach and output this traversal.

- **Djikstra's Algorithm** to compute the shortest path between two nodes

- We will write code to display a **graphical output** of our graph on a world map.

- We intend to follow the grey-box testing method to write test to verify the correctness of our code.

## Extensions, Extras, and More
 If we manage to complete the tasks mentioned above well before the
due date, we will attempt to further implement one or more of the the following features:

- A visualization of the graph using layered graph drawing (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layered_graph_drawing)

- Using the distances between airports as weights, we will use the **landmark algorithm** to find the shortest path
from one airport to another via a stopover.
