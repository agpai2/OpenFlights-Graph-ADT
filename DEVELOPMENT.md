# Project Development Log

## Week 1: 
1. Created a basic MakeFile and included the required dependencies

2. Implemented initial setup to read the OpenFlights data set in the form of a string and vector

3. Defined and implemented the airport class

    * The Airport class initializes the variables in the OpenFlights dataset

4. Implemented the basic structure of the Graph class using an adjacency matrix 

## Week 2: 
1. Created and defined the adjacency matrix using information from airport and routes data sets

2. Implemented the Breadth first traversal algorithm in the graph class

3. Wrote a few test cases to test validity of our code and edited the makefile to compile
the tests

## Week 3 and beyond: 
1. Implemented Djiktra's algorithm

2. Wrote the Landmark Path Algorithm

3. NOTE (Change of Project Goals): Since we were enable to implement A*-search due to time constraints,
    we switched our project goals to:

    * Breadth First Traversal
    * Djikstra's Algorithm
    * Visualization of Graph on a world map

    A more detailed description of the goals has also been added to the GOALS.md document.

3. Added functions to visualize the airports as well as landmark path on a world map

4. Wrote a few more test cases to test validity of our code 

5. Worked on documentation, output, and minor bug fixes
