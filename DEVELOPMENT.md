# Project Development Log

## Week 1: 
1. Created a basic MakeFile and included the required dependencies

2. Implemented initial setup to read the OpenFlights data set in the form of a string and vector

3. Defined and implemented the airport class

    * The Airport class initializes the variables in the OpenFlights dataset

4. Implemented the basic structure of the Graph class using an adjacency matrix 

## Week 2: 
1. Created and defined the adjacency matrix using information from airport and routes data sets

2. Implemented the Breadth first traversal algorithm in the graph class

3. Wrote a few test cases to test validity of our code and edited the makefile to compile
the tests
